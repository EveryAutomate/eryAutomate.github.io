# Botea User Story

## Landing Page
- User has landed on the landing page
  - They are aware of our organization and offerings.
  - They know about our solutions: building AI apps, automating business processes using AI.
  - They understand our pricing model (contact sales).
  - They know what the solutions offer.
  - User gains trust in the solutions (awareness, interest, desire, action).
  - The user decides to log in.

## Login & Signup
- User logs in or signs up by providing the necessary information.
- User confirms and agrees to our terms of service.
- User sets up billing information (upfront payment requested to show investor interest).
- User is redirected to their dashboard.

## Dashboard Access
- User has access to various resources.
- User can navigate easily without a learning curve.
- User can interact with a virtual assistant for queries and conversation.

## New Project Creation
- User initiates and configures a new project.
- User decides to proceed to the next phase.
- User views the development workflow (current progress, past actions, upcoming steps, estimated completion).

## Discovery Phase (Spreading Domain Knowledge)
- User answers questions regarding the project.
- AI provides canvases for the user to fill out.
- AI is available for guidance and questions throughout the process.
- User can only proceed after fully completing the canvases.
- AI pre-fills some canvases based on previous answers.
- Emphasis is placed on thoroughly refining this phase.
- AI suggests improvements for the canvases.
- Users can upload pre-made documents to assist AI in auto-filling the canvases.

## Design Collaboration
- User accesses a design pad (similar to Excalidraw).
- AI visualizes the canvas responses using UML diagrams.
- Diagrams map out use cases and capture the process flow.
- AI explains the diagrams to the user.
- User can clarify aspects of the diagrams with AI.
- User can manually edit or ask AI to modify the diagrams.
- User confirms the design is satisfactory.
- AI might suggest further improvements.

## System Design Phase
- User continues to have access to the design pad.
- AI guides the user in decomposing the solution, strategizing, connecting, organizing, and defining the system design.
- Steps are sequential, with diagrams and tools facilitated by AI and the system.
- Once the user and AI establish a ubiquitous language, the next phase is initiated.

## Code Generation & Testing
- AI generates development artifacts.
- User (or a domain expert) ensures AI-generated code aligns with the design.
- The development environment is configured based on project requirements.
- The application architecture is set up.
- AI generates code from the artifacts (using tools like pylint to reduce bugs).
- The system automates tests (unit, integration, system, A/B testing).
- The system fixes any bugs encountered.
- User inspects the developed system to see if it meets expectations.

## Feedback & Iteration
- User reviews the developed system and provides feedback.
- AI implements the required improvements iteratively.

## Deployment Phase
- AI performs quality assurance on the system.
- AI configures the system for deployment with CI/CD tools and automation workflows.
- The system is deployed.

## Monitoring & Improvement
- Metrics on the deployed system are continuously collected.
- AI suggests improvements based on the product strategy defined in the canvases.
- User approves necessary improvements.

## Next Steps
- TBD based on project progress and user interactions.
